# Claude Code Instructions

See [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) for project structure, commands, and development standards.

## Quick Rules
- Follow WordPress Coding Standards (PHP, JS, CSS)
- Sanitize all input, escape all output
- Use text domain `enable-navigation-icons` for all translatable strings
- Build with `npm run build` before testing changes
- Keep versions synced across `package.json`, `enable-navigation-icons.php`, and `readme.txt`
